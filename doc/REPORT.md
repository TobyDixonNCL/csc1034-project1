I am familiar with python programming and have used it in the past.
Following the instructions for this practical has shown me that I have a lot
to learn as I dont think the way I learnt to program follows the general conventions.
I had briefly used PyCharm before this course, but it was never my favoured IDE.
I have become more familiar with it however, during this practical, and I think 
(in the long run) it is going to become something that benefits my workflow massively.
I have also had a very brief experience with using git repositories to store projects, 
but I found it difficult to get my head around. I now understand them a bit better, and
think that using them will also make my workflow more efficient.
